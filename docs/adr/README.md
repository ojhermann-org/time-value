# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records the significant design decisions behind `time_value`, in
the lightweight [Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
The practice itself is [ADR-0001](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md).

## How to add one

1. Copy [`0000-adr-template.md`](0000-adr-template.md) to the next free number,
   `NNNN-kebab-title.md`.
2. Fill in Context → Decision → Consequences → Alternatives considered.
3. Commit it **with the change it describes**.
4. Add a row to the index below.

An Accepted ADR is immutable. To change a decision, write a new ADR that marks
the old one **Superseded** (link both ways) — don't rewrite the old one.
