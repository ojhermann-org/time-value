//! Typed results for the MCP tools (ADR-0039).
//!
//! Each tool returns one of these DTOs wrapped in [`rmcp::Json`], so the tool
//! macro derives and declares the `outputSchema` from the type and the value
//! lands in the response's `structuredContent`. The shapes are **uniform and
//! reused** across the tool families (ADR-0028 §4, amended by ADR-0039): a
//! monetary result is `{ value, currency? }`, a rate or period count is
//! `{ value }`. Building them *from* the library [`Money`] value is the single
//! place the [`Currency`] echo (ADR-0037) is applied, instead of at every tool
//! site.
//!
//! The DTOs live here, in the binary crate — the `no_std` core carries no wire
//! contract (ADR-0005, ADR-0011).
