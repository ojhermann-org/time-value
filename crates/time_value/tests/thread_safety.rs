//! The thread-safety contract (ADR-0046): the owned public value types are
//! `Send + Sync + 'static`, and the borrowing views are `Send + Sync`.
//!
//! All hold trivially today — the types are plain data with no interior
//! mutability — so this test is green immediately. Its job is to *lock* the
//! profile: it fails to compile the moment a field regresses it (e.g. an `Rc` or
//! `Cell` added to a public type silently dropping `Sync`), turning an invisible
//! semver break into a build error. The lock is zero-cost and zero-dependency.
//!
//! The periodicity tag is `PhantomData`, so one representative marker witnesses
//! the whole family. Assertions are feature-gated to mirror each type's own gate
//! (`alloc` for `OwnedCashflows`; `std`/`libm` for the transcendental-math types).
