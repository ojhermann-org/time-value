//! `time-value` — the command-line interface for the [`time_value`] library.
//!
//! A thin calculator over the library's operations (see
//! `docs/adr/0010-cli-surface.md`, extended by `docs/adr/0028-binary-surface-conventions.md`).
//! Commands are grouped by relationship family: `series` (net present/future
//! value, IRR, MIRR, and the dated XNPV/XIRR), `single-sum` (present/future value
//! and the solve-for `nper`/`rate` inverses), `annuity` (ordinary, annuity-`due`,
//! and perpetuity forms, plus the `nper`/`rate` solves), `rate` (conversions
//! between periodicities and nominal/effective quotes — the only family that
//! takes a periodicity), and `amortize` (a schedule). `--rate` is a per-period
//! rate (annual for the dated `series xnpv`/`xirr`); cashflows are positional.
//! Most results print as a plain number, or as a `{ "value": … }` JSON object
//! with `--json` (ADR-0039); `amortize` prints a table, or a
//! `{ "schedule": [ … ] }` JSON object under `--json`. A global
//! `--currency <CODE>` flag (default `XXX`, currency-agnostic) denominates every
//! amount in an ISO 4217 currency; a non-`XXX` code is echoed alongside monetary
//! results (`docs/adr/0034-money-and-currency.md`, ADR-0037).
